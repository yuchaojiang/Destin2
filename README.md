## Description
Destin2 is a statistical framework for cross-modality dimension reduction, clustering, and trajectory reconstruction of single-cell ATAC-seq data. The main functionalities are as follows:
  
  * Constructs cross-modality analyses of cellular-level epigenomic profiles such as peak accessibility, motif deviation, and pseudo-gene activity
  * Leverages cross-modality integration for clustering, trajectory inference, and visualization
